		<strong> Green Book </strong> <em>  New York City bouncer Frank "Tony Lip" Vallelonga is searching for new employment after his nightclub is closed for renovations, eventually landing
		an interview as a driver for "Doc" Don Shirley, a famed pianist. Their first encounter does not go well, as Tony's flippant, uncultured behavior clashes with Don's sophisticated, reserved demeanor. However, Don eventually hires Tony on the strength of others' word, 
		as he needs someone who can help him stay out of trouble during an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South. They embark with plans to return home on Christmas Eve.
		Tony is given a copy of the Green Book by Don's record studio: a guide for black travelers to find safe havens throughout the segregated South.
		They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading further south. Tony and Don clash over their differences, as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to 
		act properly, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. Regardless, Tony finds himself impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and increasingly disgusted 
		by the discriminatory treatment the latter receives by the hosts when he is not on stage. After a bar incident leads to a group of white men threatening Don's life,
		Tony rescues him by threatening to pull a gun on them. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour..

           <h3>Beautiful Mind </h3>	
		<strong> Beautiful Mind </strong> <em>  
A person born in Bluefield, in West Virginia state, John Nash showed himself to be introverted and quiet as a child.
		He preferred reading and carrying out his own experiments rather than playing with other children. He was fascinated by codes and intricate patterns.
		He was also fond of pranks. He intended to follow in his father’s footsteps and become and engineer. He received a scholarship to study at Carnegie Institute of Technology
		where he abandoned engineering after one year in order to study mathematics.
Not popular with his fellow students, he distinguished himself as being rather arrogant and odd. Even after he went on to study at Princeton he remained unpopular with his fellows.
 In spite of this, his teachers and tutors recognized his potential. Though he often was seen wandering around lost in thought, he was also seen as an eccentric scholar.

At Princeton Nash began conducting research in game theory. This led to his own emerging thought which emerged as “Nash’s Theorem.” 
This early work was seen as important, but it would not be for several years that his work was truly recognized, and he would receive the Nobel Prize.

           <h3>The Prestiege </h3>	
		<strong> Prestiege </strong> <em>  In Victorian London, illusionist Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow illusionist Robert Angier. Borden's indictment is largely possible because of the eyewitness account of John Cutter,
 who saw Borden backstage in the area where Angier was killed. At the end of one of his shows, Angier fell through a trap door in the stage floor into a clear water-filled tank below, that tank which is a prop for one of Angier's tricks performed earlier in the show. 
 Angier ended up drowning as the tank was locked after he fell into it. Borden, Angier and Cutter have a shared largely turbulent history, which also provides motive.
 Early in their magic careers, both Borden and Angier worked under "Milton the Magician", while Angier's wife Julia worked as his on-stage assistant, and Cutter as his ingénieur - staging the tricks and providing the apparatus required - work that he still does for others.
 Based on a specific incident during this stage of their relationship led to both Borden and Angier striking out creating their own shows and they having a
 feud which was not only in the professional realm but a personal one, where each man wanted to ruin the other. While Borden is arguably more accomplished in the
 technical aspects of the illusions, Angier is the more accomplished showman. In the professional realm, they tried to outdo each other, especially in the illusions
 considered either the most dangerous and/or mysterious, those two being catching the shot bullet trick, and more so the transported man trick. In the process of 
 their feud, they seemingly were not averse to any means, even with collateral damage of others. The question is if those means extend to murder, especially of the
 other.

Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to 
an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy 
combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize 
the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. 
Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.

           <h3>King's Speech</h3>	
		<strong> King's Speech</strong> <em> 

Biopic about Britain's King George VI (father of present day Queen Elizabeth II) and his lifelong struggle to overcome his speech impediment.
 Suffering from a stammer from the age of 4 or 5, the young Prince Albert dreaded any public speaking engagement. History records that his speech at the closing of 
 the 1925 Commonwealth exhibition in London was difficult for both him and everyone listening that day. He tried many different therapies over many years 
 but it was only when he met Lionel Logue, a speech therapist, that he truly began to make progress. Logue did not have a medical degree but had worked as
 an elocution coach in the theater and had worked with shell-shocked soldiers after World War I. Through a variety of techniques and much hard work, 
 Albert learns to speak in such a way so as to make his impediment a minor problem and deliver a faultless speech heard around the world by radio when the UK declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939. The King and Logue remained lifelong friends.
